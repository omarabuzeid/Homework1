# Robinhood: A Case Study

## Overview and Origin

Founded on April 18, 2013 by Vladimir Tenev and Baiju Bhatt, Robinhood Markets Inc. is a financial services company that offers people the ability to invest in a number of different assets via their website and/or mobile app. According to the company's StackShare page, "Robinhood started with a simple idea: using technology, we can re-think the way financial services operate. We cut out the fat that makes other financial services costly — legacy technology, hundreds of storefront locations, and paper-based accounting. And as a result, we radically reduce costs."

Robinhood was founded with USD 3 million in seed funding. To date however, the company has receieved USD 2.2 billion in funding through seven rounds according to Craft, the enterprise intelligence platform. Robinhood first raised USD 13 million in Series A funding in September 2014. In May 2015, they raised USD 50 million in Series B funding. Then in April, 2017 the company raised USD 110 million is Series C funding. 13 months later, they raised a further USD 363 million in Series D funding. By October 2019, they raised an additional USD 373 in series E funding. In May and July of 2020, Robinhood raised USD 600 in Series F funding. A month later, they raised USD 200 million in Series G-1 funding. Most recently, Robinhood raised USD 460 million in Series G-2 funding in September 2020, for a post-money valuation of USD 11.7 billion. 



## Business Activities:

According to the company's website, Robinhood's founders ".. discovered that big Wall Street firms were paying next-to-nothing to trade stocks, while most Americans were charged commission for every single trade. So they decided to change that, and headed back to California to build a financial product that would enable everyone—not just the wealthy—access to financial markets."

Robinhood intends to democratize finance for all, therefore their target customer is any US resident with a bank account. Robinhood doesn't charge it's users any commission fees and does not have an account minimum, allowing virtually anyone to use their product. Up until October, 2019, Robinhood was the only major broker that offered zero-commission trading. Since then however, even well-established brokers made the switch to zero-commission trading, growing increasingly defensive as Robinhood continued to grow. 

Since “free” is no longer a meaningful competitive differentiator, cutomer acquisition is crucial to Robinhood's survival. Fortunately, Robinhood's no account/investing minimums, simplified information presentation, and use of behavioral triggers that reward certain actions to encourage frequent use, remain the company's primary source of competitive advantage over most legacy brokers, particularly with lower-value first-time investors. Consequently the company has seen explosive user growth over the past few years. 

Robinhood leverages a variety of technologies. According to the company's StackShare page, the programming languages they use(d) to develop their mobile app and website include: Python, Go, Swift, & Kotlin. The company leverages React, a JavaScript Library to build it's user interface (UI), and uses Bootsrap to develop popular UI components and interactions. They also use Faust to build streaming applications Robinhood also leverages Django for web development. Furthermore, the company leverages NGINX, a high performance free open source web server powering busiest sites on the Internet, to power it's website. They use Kafka and RabbitMQ to develop their messaging system that allows them to offer 24/7 customer service to their users. The company use Redis as an in-memory database, and leverage Amazon EC2 to rent virtual computers on which to run their own computer applications. 

Furthermore, Robinhood leverages other utilities and technologies internally such as Google Analytics to analyze their performance and customer base, collaboration platforms such as G-Suite and GitHub for project management, and Slack for internal communication. 


## Landscape:

Though Robinhood is expanding - and will continue to expand - it's services into different financial industries, the company still primarily operates in the brokerage industry. As a consequence of the disruption Robinhood has caused, the industry has trended towards zero commission fees for retail investors, particularly in equity markets. Another trend in the industry has been the rise of specialized firms. These firms unbundled the offerings of the full-service providers and concentrated on specific sources of value to investors.

Another trend within the industry has been the evolution towards a do-it-youself investing model. While financial advisory still exists, particularly among higher commission accounts, most brokers have pivoted to becoming more suppliers of tools rather than providers of advice. They provide charts, research and execution tools but stop short of recommending specific investment ideas. This again is largely a result of the disruption caused by Robinhood. As part of Robinhood's mission to democratize finance, they have been educating their users in finance to cut down on the costs of hiring financial advisors. Similarly, another trend is an adjacent industry has been the rise of the Robo Advisor, which many brokerage firms now offer as another way to cut down on costs. 

The major brokerage companies that Robinhood competes with are the legacy brokerage firms: Charles Shwab, TD Ameritrade, and E-trade. With that said, many other digital brokerages and adjacent services have emerged in recent years, with the majority acting in the business-to-consumer (B2C) space. However, relatively few of these newer digital brokerages are competing with Robinhood directly. Instead, they favor comparatively niche markets or provide investment products alongside more mainstream financial services. 


## Results

Almost overnight, Robinhood gave millions of first-time investors easy access to the stock markets by making trading simple and, perhaps more importantly, free. The company completely disrupted the brokerage industry, and has been almost single-handedly responsible for the move to zero commission trading for retail investors accross the industry. The company has also empowered millions of people to start investing and becoming more financially knowledgable because of the low barriers to investing that they have created. 

There are several metrics by which we can guage Robinhood's success. One such metric is user growth. Robinhood has seen incredible growth in it's userbase over the past few years. According to the BussinessofApps.com, the number of users grew from 1 million in 2016, to 13 million in 2020. Moreover, according to a report by Fortune.com, Robinhood has an estimated 15 million users as of October 2020, eclipsing that of it's major competitors, Charles Schwab (14.3 million), TD Ameritrade (13.7 million), and E-Trade (6 million). Another possible metric to use is average daily trading volume. According to the same report by Fortune, Robinhood averaged 4,310 trade per day in June, 2020.  That number was significantly higher than Charles Schwab (1,800), TD Ameritrade (3,839), and E-Trade (1,114). 

With that said, Robinhood is lagging behind it's competitors in other important metrics. According to BussinessofApps.com, Robinhood has USD 20 billion assets under management, compared to (E-Trade: USD 600 million), (TDAmeritrade: USD 1.3 trillion), and (Charles Schwab: USD 3.8 trillion). This is primarily because Robinhood's average account size is between USD 1000-5000, compared to USD 100,000 for E-Trade and TD Ameritrade, and USD 240,000 for Charles Schwab.



## Recommendations

The goal for Robinhood is to grow it's userbase to capitalize on it's high-volume, low-margin model. The company will also likely have to focus on increasing the value of its average user, rather than on sheer volume alone. Robinhood may have strong user growth, but its competitors have significantly more assets under management. 

Therefore my personal recommendations for Robinhood are:-

1: Expand possible investments offerings to include bonds, mutual funds, and commodities such as metals, oil and gas, and agricultural assets. Moreover, provide users with the able to trade on the Foreign Exchange Market. This will enable the company to match the offerings of the legacy brokers it is competiting with, and attract higher-value investors. 

2: Further reduce the barriers to entry in investing by offering an automated investment product. Develop and leverage RoboAdvisors to create a number of different portfolios that users can invest in passively. This will help Robinhood gain more users and win a larger market share by competing directly against other FinTech firms and RoboAdvisors such as WealthSimple. 

While the first recommendation can be adopted without the leveraging of any new technologies, Robinhood will need to utilize additional technologies for the second. Python, a programming language it already leverages, will enable Robinhood to develop simple trading bot by creating a trading algorithm.  With that said, Robinhood should leverage machine-learning and deep-learning technology so that it's bot can become smarter and more sophisticated with time, and as Robinhood's user base increases.
